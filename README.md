## 🌟 About

Type_Software is more than just a collection of projects—it's a philosophy. We believe that the best way to learn software development is by working with real, functional code that can be immediately used, modified, and improved upon.

### Our Mission
- **Student-Focused**: Designed specifically for learners who want to understand real-world software, web, and game development
- **Highly Modifiable**: Every line of code is open for inspection, modification, and improvement
- **Production Ready**: These aren't just demos—they're real tools that can be used in actual projects
- **Community Driven**: Built by and for a community of developers passionate about learning and building together
